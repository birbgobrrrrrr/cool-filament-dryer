very cool filament dryer
 


Hi! I madwe a filament dryer because i didnt feel like paying over 30$ for it, and it just sounded pretty cool. This dryer does use vaccuum technology or dessicant, but instead uses heat to "bake" the PCB. The 12V PCB heatbed and blower fans help circulate hot air around the chamber, while the timer module and temp sensor allow this project to be functional without the help of a PCB or dedicated code. 

BOM:

1x 12V PCB heatbed
1x JZ801 timer module
1x w1209 temp controller
2x blower fans
1x 12v PSU
4x silicone spacers
a lot of ABS
